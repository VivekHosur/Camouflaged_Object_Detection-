Gotcha 👍
Here’s the **same README**, but with **clean spacing, strong bolding, emojis, and clear section breaks** so it looks **attractive and professional on GitHub**.

# 🦎 **Camouflaged Object Detection with Boundary Localization**

### *In Complex Backgrounds*

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

**Camouflaged Object Detection (COD)** is one of the most challenging problems in computer vision because the target objects intentionally or naturally blend into their surroundings.

This project proposes a **CNN-based deep learning framework** that not only detects camouflaged objects but also **accurately localizes their boundaries**, even in **low-contrast and complex scenes**.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

* ✅ Detect camouflaged objects in complex environments
* ✅ Accurately localize object boundaries
* ✅ Reduce background interference
* ✅ Improve robustness and generalization

---

## 🧠 **Proposed Methodology**

The system follows a **dual-branch encoder–decoder CNN architecture**:

1. **Input Image Acquisition**
2. **Preprocessing**

   * Image resizing
   * Normalization
3. **Feature Extraction**

   * CNN encoder for hierarchical features
4. **Multi-scale Feature Fusion**
5. **Dual Output Prediction**

   * 🟢 **Segmentation Mask**
   * 🔵 **Boundary Localization Map**
6. **Post-processing & Visualization**
